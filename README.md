# Morse Simulation

## Overview

<!-- morse_simulation is a simulation environment used to run multi-robot experiments using docker+ROS+Morse. -->
morse_simulation is a simulation environmet based on docker and docker-compose used to run multi-robot experiments [ROS]+[Morse] in the Software Engineering Lab (LES) at University of Brasilia.

**Keywords:** simulation, multi-robot, mobile robots, simulation environment, morse, ROS
